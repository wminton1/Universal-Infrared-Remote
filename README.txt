What is this?This was a short project I did to make a custom Universal (5+1 in Japanese) Remote. Why did I do this?I use a popular brand of TV and I have a few of that same brand TV in my home. A lot of times, I cannot find the remote and have to stop what I’m doing on my phone and resort to the companion app to use it so I set out to make a smaller form factor remote with the only the buttons I care to use and snap it to the magsafe magnet on my phone.What was the process?Many consumer electronics manufacturers have their own transmission protocols and for this particular TV brand I have I couldn’t find a consensus online.So, I took an old TV and salvaged an infrared receiver and connected it to an ESP32 WroomD and luckily found a Library that could translate codes from the Universal Remote I already had to Hex on the microcontroller I bought impulsively (I really should have done this first). After I captured the specific codes (instead of the codes for every single input), I removed the translation and rewrote the code to send and added an infrared transmitter bulb to cap off the project.How do I use this?Get a microcontroller and a follow the instructions for your specific microcontroller but be aware, this code has not been tested on any other microcontroller other than a ESP32 WROOM D
